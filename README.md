  ## Description

  The original version of this web app was built using Node.js as the back-end language and Handlebars.js as the templating engine. What makes this project special is the transition from the original Node.js foundation to the power of Python. I decided to harness the versatility and elegance of Python, along with the Python Flask framework, to reimagine and refine the application's user interfaces.
